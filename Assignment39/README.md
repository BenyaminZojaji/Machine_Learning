## Weather Forecast: (Linear Regression)
- The climate of a particular city is recorded every hour during different years. So, weather information is recorded 24 times per day.
- Draw an output table on a chart.
- Teach a linear model[^1] on the above data using the perceptron algorithm

[^1]: I am aware of linear model can not fit the data perfectly. This assignment will be solve as a polynomial regression soon.
